    <p>
       This was an attempt at making a small, monospaced, outline font that would be
 geometrically regular and simple. The endeavor was motivated by a deep
 adoration of old-school console bitmap fonts, of Consolas, of Pragmata Pro,
 as well as a novice's curiosity for typographical design.
